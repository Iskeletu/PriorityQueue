# PriorityQueue

PriorityQueue is a C program that creates a vaccination queue base on the following criteria:

- Working Field
- Age
- Health Condition

The registered people are divided in 5 groups:

- Phase One
People that work with health care and/or are above 75 years old.

- Phase Two
People that are btween 60 and 74 years old.

- Phase Three
People that have health conditions.

- Phase Four
People that work in the teaching fiel or public decurity field.

- Non Priority
Everyone that isn't part of the four groups listed above.

## Usage

No user input/configuration necessary, the program will simply run every benchmark for every sorting algorithm implementation (starting with 2000 integers vector up to 128000) based on your computer specs.

The program will display information for every benchmark:

```bash
Algorithm: *algorithm name*
Vector Size: 2000 ~ 128000
Vector Generation Type: Ascending/Descending/Random
Runtime: *time elapsed*
Memory Usage: *Memory used (MB)*
```

The same information is stored on "Benchmark\BenchmarkResults.dat".

Included default benchmark results (see "System info").
